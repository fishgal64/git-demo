Economic Data Collection (EDC) Overview

All participants of the West Coast Groundfish Trawl Fishery must complete an annual Economic Data Collection (EDC) form as required by The next link/button will exit from NWFSC web site regulation 50 CFR 660.114. Participants can complete and return the forms received in the mail, complete an online form, or submit a paper form by downloading the applicable form below and returning the completed form by mail.

EDC Forms are required from:

Limited Entry Trawl Catcher Vessels - All owners, lessees, and charterers of a catcher vessel registered to a limited entry trawl endorsed permit at any time in 2012 and beyond.
Catcher/Processors - All owners, lessees, and charterers of a catcher processor vessel registered to a catcher/processor-endorsed limited entry trawl permit at any time in 2012 and beyond.
Motherships - All owners, lessees, and charterers of a mothership vessel registered to a mothership permit at any time in 2012 and beyond.
First Receivers - All owners of a first receiver site license in 2012 and beyond.
Shorebased Processors - All owners and lessees of a shorebased processor that received round or headed and- gutted IFQ groundfish species or whiting from a first receiver in 2012 and beyond.
Submitting Your EDC Forms

Each May, EDC forms are mailed to all fishery participants. Completed forms are due every year by September 1. Fishery participants are responsible for completing forms by the deadline whether or not they received the EDC forms by mail. Failure to submit the required EDC forms can delay permit renewal, vessel registration, license issuance, and quota transfers.

Types of Data Collected

EDC forms include information on vessel/plant characteristics, capitalized investments, annual expenses, annual earnings, crew/labor payments, and quota and permit expenses.

What happens to the data once submitted?

Fishery managers use the data to determine whether the Catch Share program is meeting its goals of:

increasing the fishery's net economic benefits
creating individual economic stability for participants
providing full utilization of the trawl sector groundfish allocation
achieving individual accountability of catch and bycatch.
All data is aggregated and confidential. Aggregated data and analyses are used to generate EDC Reports, which are presented annually to the Pacific Fishery Management Council.

You can explore the data, generate charts and tables, and download aggregate EDC data using the Fisheries Economics Explorer (  The next link/button will exit from NWFSC web site FISHEyE).
